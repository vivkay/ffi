<b>Fauna & Flora International’s Pippa Howard explains the links between waste, landscapes and livelihoods and why we should be re-thinking our approach to waste management.</b>

Waste. It is all around us, piling up under our sinks, being buried in landfills, polluting soils, and suffocating marine life. But no matter how we try to cover it up or ship it away, this is one environmental problem too big to be ignored.

In most of the countries where I have worked, waste management infrastructure is poor or lacking, leaving a grungy impression of haphazard ignorance and neglect. A shabby, dirty manifestation of an ‘I don’t care’ attitude. In truth, it is more likely to be an indication of not being able to afford proper waste management, of not knowing how or not knowing why waste is a problem.

Even in sophisticated cities like Cambridge, discarded plastic wrappers and aluminium cans scar the urban landscape, and choke the River Cam and Hobson’s Brook. We seem not to care, despite all the legal frameworks and education at our disposal, so to speak.
