<b>As environmental challenges change and intensify, our means of addressing them must also adapt. In this instalment of our jargon buster blog series, Kristi Foster considers two strategies for environmental management that are rapidly gaining traction worldwide: ecosystem and landscape approaches.</b>

Picture a species, a habitat and a natural resource. Under traditional environmental management, these might be considered as separate components of ecosystems. But in fact these components are inextricably linked through dynamic processes and interactions over space and time.

Take salmon in the Pacific Northwest, for example. When mature salmon return from the ocean to spawn in rivers, they provide an important food source for bears preparing for hibernation. As the bears gorge, they carry enormous quantities of fish from streams into forests, leaving the remains to decompose on the forest floor.

These discarded, nutrient-rich carcasses benefit many species, including millions of insects, small crabs, and larger species such as eagles and wolves. But salmon are also an excellent source of nitrogen, and the carcasses left in forests act as a powerful fish fertilizer, allowing coastal rainforest trees to reach incredible sizes.

Through this story of complex interactions, salmon species transport nutrients from the ocean, up rivers and into forests, nourishing entire ecosystems.

When human actions push these kinds of interactions out of balance – for example through pollution, overfishing, climate change or altered river flows – we jeopardise not only the salmon population itself, but also entire systems of life, including our own. These effects are almost impossible to understand and predict unless we consider how ecosystems function as a whole.
