<b>Fauna & Flora International’s Pippa Howard explains why NGOs, consultancies and other conservationists are joining forces to bring about biodiversity conservation in the private sector.</b>

What would you think if I told you that conservation is rarely about managing wildlife, but almost always about understanding and managing people?

This might seem an exaggeration, but let’s think about a theme that’s gaining momentum worldwide: business and biodiversity. This evolving discipline brings together conservationists, businesses and the influencers of business (such as governments and financial institutions) to help the private sector protect biodiversity.

Now let’s imagine the profiles of a few people. First, take Scott – a mine manager for a mid-sized, UK-based mining company, who has worked his way up to his current position over the past eight years. Scott spends his weekends hiking and camping outdoors with his kids, which makes him acutely aware of the impacts his company has on nature in other parts of the world, as well as the potential to do things differently. But his company is riding a wave of fluctuating oil prices that batter its bottom line, and Scott himself is conscious that his ideas, if not well received, could jeopardise his chances of promotion.

As much as we need to ask scientific, technical questions to protect biodiversity, we also have to ask things like: what motivates a mining company’s environmental team? What makes a government tick? What drives industry to make better choices?

Conservation solutions are fundamentally about understanding, managing and supporting people, so it follows that the more people we involve, the better our chances of success.

An excellent example is the emerging global ‘community of practice’ focused on business and biodiversity. Here, practitioners in the business and biodiversity niche will put their heads together to share solutions, generate tools and methodologies, and combine technical expertise and geographic experience.

Fauna & Flora International (FFI) and other like-minded conservation NGOs worldwide have developed – or are currently developing – programmes that focus on working with the private sector to bring about positive change for biodiversity.

What makes this approach to sustainable development so promising is that instead of designing projects that only focus on a single sector or issue (for example a specific species or habitat), we are tackling the cross-sectoral challenges that conservation demands. This approach considers not just the fundamentals of ecology, but also human rights and needs, and the governance required to enable and empower those who depend on biodiversity.

Bringing together a broad mix of professionals will provide members of this community of practice with access to an incredible wealth of technical know-how and experience far beyond what we have as individual organisations. This pooling of resources will allow us to drive best practice, and to fast-track it in areas of high biodiversity. As a group, we also have the potential to increase the ability of partner organisations and stakeholders to implement business and biodiversity initiatives.

It’s not an easy task to re-think our individual approaches to biodiversity conservation, but with a lot of collaboration, transparency and the conviction to stand by our principles, we have the tools needed to create better outcomes for all.
