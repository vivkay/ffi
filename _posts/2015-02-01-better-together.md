<b>Fauna & Flora International’s Pippa Howard explains why NGOs, consultancies and other conservationists are joining forces to bring about biodiversity conservation in the private sector.</b>

What would you think if I told you that conservation is rarely about managing wildlife, but almost always about understanding and managing people?

This might seem an exaggeration, but let’s think about a theme that’s gaining momentum worldwide: business and biodiversity. This evolving discipline brings together conservationists, businesses and the influencers of business (such as governments and financial institutions) to help the private sector protect biodiversity.

Now let’s imagine the profiles of a few people. First, take Scott – a mine manager for a mid-sized, UK-based mining company, who has worked his way up to his current position over the past eight years. Scott spends his weekends hiking and camping outdoors with his kids, which makes him acutely aware of the impacts his company has on nature in other parts of the world, as well as the potential to do things differently. But his company is riding a wave of fluctuating oil prices that batter its bottom line, and Scott himself is conscious that his ideas, if not well received, could jeopardise his chances of promotion.
