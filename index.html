<h4>Fewer than 900 mountain gorillas remain</h4>
<p> One of the worldâ€™s strongest and mightiest creatures has become one of the most vulnerable. Despite the ongoing successes in our work to protect Africa's mountain gorillas, their numbers are perilously low. Your support could help us to protect the gorillas in their natural habitat and enable their numbers rise. Please donate today to help save the mountain gorilla.</p>
