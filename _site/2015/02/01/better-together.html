<p>What would you think if I told you that conservation is rarely about managing wildlife, but almost always about understanding and managing people?</p>
<p>This might seem an exaggeration, but let’s think about a theme that’s gaining momentum worldwide: business and biodiversity.

Scott spends his weekends hiking and camping outdoors with his kids, which makes him acutely aware of the impacts his company has on nature in other parts of the world, as well as the potential to do things differently. But his company is riding a wave of fluctuating oil prices that batter its bottom line, and Scott himself is conscious that his ideas, if not well received, could jeopardise his chances of promotion.</p>
