        <div class="icon-home">
        <i class="i-support"></i>
      </div>
      <p>Biodiversity is critical for the life support systems that humans and all other species rely on – from provision of freshwater to shelter and food. Without the diversity of species, ecosystems are more vulnerable to natural disasters, human disturbance and climate change.
<br>
<br>
Sadly, the stunning array of species is under serious threat, from habitat loss, pollution, hunting and a myriad other pressures. Biodiversity is being lost at 1,000 times the natural rate.
<br>
<br>
Whichever way you look at it, whether it is moral or economic, mankind has an imperative to protect it. All of us, from governments to businesses to individuals, need to work together if we are to save our planet’s rich natural resources.</p>
